                <button class="faq-question">What is a Tech Check?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    A Tech Check is a free 30-minute call where we look at your current tech setup, identify what's working and what's not, and figure out if we're a good fit to work together. No sales pitch — just an honest conversation about your needs.

                <button class="faq-question">How do I book a Tech Check?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    You can book a Tech Check directly on our website. Just click the "Book a Tech Check" button and pick a time that works for you. You'll get a confirmation email with all the details.

                <button class="faq-question">What happens after the Tech Check?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    After our call, I'll send you a proposal outlining what I found, what I recommend, and what it'll cost. If it makes sense for both of us, we move forward. If not, no hard feelings.

                <button class="faq-question">How long does setup take?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    It depends on the package. Light setups typically take 1-2 weeks. Standard setups take 2-3 weeks. Full setups with websites and training can take 3-4 weeks. I'll give you a clear timeline in your proposal.

                <button class="faq-question">What's included in monthly support?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Monthly support includes ongoing help with your tech — answering questions, troubleshooting issues, maintaining your website, and keeping your automations running. The level of support depends on your plan (Basic, Standard, or Premium).

                    <strong>Basic ($100/mo)</strong> — Email support, 48-hour response, monthly check-in.<br><br>
                    <strong>Standard ($175/mo)</strong> — Email + text support, 24-hour response, monthly check-in, website maintenance, 1 automation maintained.<br><br>
                    <strong>Premium ($250/mo)</strong> — Email, text + phone support, same-day response, bi-weekly check-ins, all automations maintained, monthly strategy session.

                <button class="faq-question">Do you build websites?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes. Website builds are included in the Full setup package ($800). I build clean, simple sites that work — not overcomplicated templates that break. If you just need a landing page or updates to an existing site, we can discuss that too.

                <button class="faq-question">Do you build automations?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes. Automations are included in the Standard and Full setup packages. I use tools like Zapier to connect your apps — things like automatically adding new leads to your CRM, sending follow-up emails, or syncing data between tools.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    I work with most common small business tools — Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Notion, Calendly, Stripe, Square, Shopify, Zapier, and more. If you use something I haven't worked with before, I'll learn it or let you know upfront.

                <button class="faq-question">How much does it cost?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Setup packages range from $300-$800 (one-time). Monthly support ranges from $100-$250/month. Most clients start with a Standard setup ($500) and Standard monthly plan ($175/mo).

                <button class="faq-question">Do I need to sign a contract?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    No contracts. Everything is month-to-month. I'd rather earn your business every month than lock you into something you can't get out of.
                </div>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    I accept credit/debit cards and ACH transfers through Stripe. You'll receive a payment link after your proposal is approved.

                <button class="faq-question">When does billing start?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Setup fees are due before work begins. Monthly billing starts on the 1st of the month after your setup is complete.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    You can cancel anytime with 14 days notice. No penalties, no hard feelings. I'll make sure you have everything you need to transition smoothly.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Monday through Friday, 9am to 5pm Central Time. I don't offer 24/7 support — but I do respond within the timeframe promised by your plan.

                    <strong>Basic</strong> — Within 48 hours<br>

                <button class="faq-question">What's the difference between response time and resolution time?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Response time is how quickly I'll acknowledge your request and start looking into it. Resolution time is how long it takes to actually fix the issue — which depends on complexity. I'll always keep you updated on progress.

                <button class="faq-question">What's NOT included in support?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Monthly support covers maintenance and troubleshooting — not new builds. If you need a new website, new automations, or major changes, that's a separate project with its own scope and pricing. I'll always be clear about what's included and what's extra.

                    Yes. Most of my work is done remotely, so location doesn't matter. As long as we can get on a call and you have internet, we're good.

                    I'll be honest with you. If it's something I can learn quickly, I'll take it on. If it's outside my wheelhouse, I'll tell you and try to point you in the right direction.
